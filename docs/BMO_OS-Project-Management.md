# BMO OS - Project Management

## **1. Project Management**

### **2.1 Project Overview**

**BMO OS** is a custom, modular Linux-based operating system built completely from source using **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** and **Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS)** methodologies.

It is designed to provide a **lightweight, developer-friendly**, and **AI-ready** environment.

The system will later integrate **Flutter** for a modern desktop experience and **local AI features** to enable intelligent offline tools such as code assistants, speech recognition, and system automation.

---

### **1.2 Project Objectives**

- Build a stable, bootable Linux-based operating system.
- Document and understand all low-level system components (kernel, libraries, network stack).
- Develop a **UI layer** as the visual system shell.
- Support **SSH**, **network configuration**, and **software management**.
- Add **Local AI capabilities** for offline intelligence and automation (future phase).
- Package the OS as a **bootable ISO** for testing and distribution.

---

### **1.3 Project Scope**

**Included:**

- Core system (kernel, init system, toolchain, utilities).
- Networking and SSH configuration.
- Bootloader setup (GRUB2) and ISO generation.
- Flutter-based / KDE graphical shell.
- Local AI engine integration (future phase).

**Not included (initial release):**

- Full package manager (planned later).
- Cloud AI or networked inference (only local).
- Advanced desktop environment (beyond UI).

### **1.4 Project Development Model**

**Incremental + Modular Development Model**

The OS will be developed in incremental phases where each phase delivers a working system layer. Future modules like **Local AI** will be added as self-contained components.

| Phase | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | LFS Core System | Basic Linux environment with CLI |
| Phase 2 | BLFS Networking & SSH | Network stack and remote access |
| Phase 3 | Bootloader & ISO | GRUB setup and bootable ISO |
| Phase 4 | Desktop UI | System interface layer |
| Phase 5 | Testing & Optimization | Final system validation |
| **Phase 6** | **Local AI Integration** | AI module for offline smart features |

---

### **1.5 Local AI Integration Plan (for future if we decide to continue)**

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Integrate an offline AI subsystem to enhance the OS with intelligent local tools. |
| **Examples** | Local chatbot, code assistant, command predictor, voice-based control, and context-aware notifications. |
| **Technology Stack** | Python (AI engine), ONNX Runtime / GGML / llama.cpp for model inference, Flutter frontend for interaction. |
| **Data Privacy** | 100% local processing â€” no external cloud access. |
| **Hardware Needs** | Minimum 4 GB RAM, x86_64 CPU with AVX2 (or ARM64). |
| **Integration Level** | Runs as a system daemon (`bmocore-ai`) communicating via sockets or REST API with UI layer. |

| **Virtualization** | QEMU, VirtualBox |
| **Editors** | Vim, VS Code , nano |
| **Testing** | GDB, DejaGNU |
| **AI Frameworks (Planned)** | ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// |

### **1.8 Project Timeline (Revised)**

| Phase | Duration | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 â€“ LFS Base System | 3 Weeks | âœ… Completed |
| Phase 2 â€“ BLFS Networking & SSH | 2 Weeks | ðŸŸ¢ In Progress |
| Phase 3 â€“ Bootloader & ISO | 1 Week | ðŸ•“ Planned |
| Phase 4 â€“  UI Layer | 3 - 4 Weeks | ðŸ•“ Planned |
| Phase 5 â€“ Testing & Optimization | 2 Weeks | ðŸ•“ Planned |
| **Phase 6 â€“ Local AI Integration** | **5 Weeks** | ðŸ•“ Future Development |

---

### **1.9 Risk Management**

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Performance Issues** | Local inference may consume heavy RAM/CPU | Use quantized models (GGUF format) |
| **Security Risks** | AI modules running with system privileges | Use sandboxing and permission limits |
| **Build Failures** | Errors in compiling packages | Keep build logs and snapshots |
| **Boot Issues** | GRUB or kernel misconfiguration | Test each step with QEMU |
| **Time Overruns** | Manual building takes time | Follow modular milestone schedule |

---

### **1.10 Communication and Reporting**

All progress, commits, and build notes are stored in the **GitHub repository**.

Documentation is maintained in:

- `README.md` â€“ Build steps and progress
- `CHANGELOG.md` â€“ Version history
- `docs/` folder â€“ SRS, SDS, AI integration plan

---

### **1.11 Project Success Criteria**

The project will be considered successful when:

1. The OS boots successfully and runs stable.
2. Networking and SSH are functional.
3. KDE UI operates as the default desktop environment.
4. The system can run and interact with a local AI module offline (not for the first release patch).
5. A bootable ISO is generated and tested successfully on real and virtual hardware.
